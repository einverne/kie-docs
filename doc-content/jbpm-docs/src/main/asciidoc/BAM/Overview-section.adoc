Imagine you are developing a BPM solution which mixes process with business data.

假设你正在开发一个 BPM 解决方案，混合了过程和商业数据。

Imagine also you need some forms to be used within processes in order to let the users enter data.

假设你需要一些表单用来在过程中让用户输入数据。

Moreover, you'll likely want to have some kind of dashboards to display metrics and key performance indicators in order to quickly assess how your processes are doing.
So far so good.

而且，你可能需要一些 dashboard 来显示指标和关键性能，来快速掌握过程执行状态。
到目前为止，一切都还好。

jBPM brings you all the ingredients you need to develop end-to-end business process solutions.
The jBPM's BAM module (also known as Dashbuilder) allows for composing custom business dashboards by mixing data coming from heterogeneous sources of information.
The module is now fully integrated into {CENTRAL}.
A new specific section for dealing with reports has been added and it can be accessed either from the home page or from the menu bar, as shown in the next figure.

In the figure, within the highlighted sections, there exists two options:

* *Business Dashboards:* This option is intended to give users access to a generic dashboard tooling for the composition of brand new dashboards.
* *Process & Task Reports:* It opens up the Process related reports pages which contains several performance indicators related to the {PROCESS_ENGINE}.

* *Business Dashboards:* 这个选项用来给用户一组通用的仪表盘工具，用来构成新的仪表盘。
* *Process & Task Reports:* 他会打开过程关联的报表页面，包含多个关联到 {PROCESS_ENGINE} 的性能指标。
